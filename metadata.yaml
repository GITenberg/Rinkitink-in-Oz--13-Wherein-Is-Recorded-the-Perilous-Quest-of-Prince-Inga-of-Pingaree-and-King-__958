description: "Rinkitink in Oz: Wherein is Recorded the Perilous Quest of Prince Inga\
  \ of Pingaree and King Rinkitink in the Magical Isles that Lie Beyond the Borderland\
  \ of Oz. is the tenth book in the Land of Oz series written by L. Frank Baum. Published\
  \ on June 20, 1916, with full-color and black-and-white illustrations by artist\
  \ John R. Neill, it is significant that no one from Oz appears in the book until\
  \ its climax; this is due to Baum's having originally written most of the book as\
  \ an original fantasy novel over ten years earlier, in 1905. Most of the action\
  \ takes place on three islands – Pingaree, Regos, and Coregos – and within the Nome\
  \ King's caverns. Since the original ruler of the nomes, Roquat – who later renamed\
  \ himself Ruggedo, was deposed in 1914's Tik-Tok of Oz, Baum had to cleverly rework\
  \ the tale to accommodate his successor, the well-intentioned – but politically\
  \ motivated – Kaliko.\nThe book was dedicated to the author's newborn grandson Robert\
  \ Alison Baum, the first child of the author's second son Robert Stanton Baum.\n\
